\arguments{
\item{eqns}{is can be a single equation or a equation system. If eqns is a
single equation it will internally be converted to a list. Estimation of a
single equation might as well be done using \code{nls()}.}

\item{data}{is the data set on which the equation is applied. This can be of
every type \code{eval()} can handle.}

\item{startvalues}{is a vector of initial start values. For}

\item{S}{is a weighing matrix used for estimation in Feasible Generalized
Non-Linear Least Squares (FGNLS) and Iterative FGNLS. For \code{nlsur()}
this is assumed to be the identity matrix. Hence, it is not included. If
included S is expected to be a matrix.}

\item{robust}{should a robust standard error be calculated}

\item{nls}{is a logical and default if estimation is done for NLSUR or NLS.}

\item{fgnls}{is a logical and must be set, if estimation is done for FGNLS.
This is called in a function called \code{fgnls()} and should not be set by
the user.}

\item{ifgnls}{is a logical and must be set, if estimation is done for ifgnls.
This is called in a function called \code{nlsur()} and should not be set by
the user.}

\item{qrsolve}{is a logical, if TRUE \code{qr.coef(qr(x), r)} is called which
should be the most robust way for estimation of nls. For this all equations
will be rbinded, which might lead to memory bottlenecks.}

\item{MASS}{is a logical, if TRUE \code{lm_gls()} is called for estimation of
a linear regression with a weighting matrix.}

\item{trace}{is a logical. If TRUE the current iterations SSR is called.}

\item{eps}{the epsilon used for convergence in nlsur(). Default is 1e-5.}

\item{tau}{is another convergence variable. Default is 1e-3.}

\item{maxiter}{maximum number of iterations}

\item{tol}{qr.solves tolerance for detecting linear dependencies.}

\item{initial}{logical if initial calculation set. used to avoid calculation
of svd numerous times}

\description{
\code{.nlsur()} is a function for estimation of a non-linear seemingly
 unrelated regression model in R.
}
\details{
nlsur is a function for estimation of a non-linear least squares
(NLS). In addition to \code{nls()} it is capable of estimation of system of
equations. This estimation is done in a non-linear seemingly unrelated
regression approach.
